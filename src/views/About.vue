    <h1>Zayste Games</h1>
    <p> Zayste Games are simple. Each game is a story. As you move through the journey, you'll have to answer questions. Every journey has exactly one correct path. </p>
    <p> If you take the correct path first, you win. The game NFT is yours. You own it.. along with all the satoshis the game accumulated. </p>
      <p> At each stage of the journey, there are a limited number of choices you can make. At the end of your journey, you'll have a chance to win the game.
    </p>
    <p>To check if you won, you'll click a button to store your journey on the blockchain. </p>
    <p>Then the game will check to see if your journey matches the winning path. </p>
    <p> If you win, the games NFT is immediately transferred to your account :) </p>
